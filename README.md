A buggy woogie program 

I am a buggy program. 
Your goal is to fix me and add a comment explaining what is the bug and why the program does not work.
go ahead line by line and debug the entire program in order to make it works.

The bugs are everywhere, use the command npm start in order to start the project.


For debug don't hesitate to use comments for making sure the first instruction is ok before passing the other.
